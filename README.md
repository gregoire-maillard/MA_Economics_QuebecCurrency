**Title:** The Unpromising Future of Quebec’s Monetary Sovereignty: A Structural Vector Autoregressive Analysis and a Labour Mobility Approach

**Date:** August 2022 

**Abstract:** On October 30th, 1995, Quebec held a referendum for independence, during which 49.42% of the Quebecois voters expressed their desires for the independence of the province. However, the question of Quebec’s monetary sovereignty has never been decisively answered, even among the sovereigntist movement. Thus, this study aims to determine if Quebec would be more thriving with its own currency or if it should continue to use the Canadian Dollar in the context of independence. Two mainstays of the theory of optimum currency areas are investigated. Despite a relative lack of benefits from labour mobility, a SVAR approach shows that Quebec is facing symmetric shocks with the other Canadian provinces. This study therefore determines that the Canadian dollar is the best option for Quebec.
